<li>i) Controllers may use treatment notes for therapeutic purposes and, after necessary de-identification, may use or disclose treatment notes for internal training and academic seminars without individual authorization.</li>
<li>j) It is appropriate for the controller to develop and implement reasonable strategies and processes to limit use and disclosure to a minimum.</li>
<li>k) Controllers are advised to confirm that the security capabilities of the processor meet the security requirements and to sign a data processing agreement before allowing the processor to perform data processing for them. Processors are advised to process data in accordance with the controller’s requirements, and processors cannot bring in third parties to assist in data processing without the controller’s permission.</li>
<li>l）Before the controller provides the data to the third party controller authorized by the government, it is appropriate to obtain the relevant documents with the official seal of the government, and after the data is provided, the responsibility for data security and the security of the transmission channel shall be borne by the third party controller.</li>
<li>m) The controller may use the limited data set for scientific research, healthcare services, public health and other purposes after confirming the legality, legitimacy and necessity of data use and that the user has the appropriate data security capabilities, and the user has signed a data use agreement and committed to protecting the personal healthcare data in the limited data set; the user may only use the data within the scope agreed upon in the agreement and assume the responsibility for data security, and after the use of the data is completed, it is appropriate to return, completely destroy or otherwise dispose of the data in accordance with the controller’s requirements. Users may not disclose data to third parties without the permission of the controller.</li>
<li>n) If the controller obtains health-related data that does not identify the individual after aggregation and analysis of personal health data, the data is no longer personal information, but its use and disclosure are subject to other relevant national regulatory requirements.<br>o) If the controller needs to provide the corresponding data outside of China for academic research, after the necessary de-identification process and after discussion and approval by the Data Security Committee, non-confidential and non-important data within 250 items can be provided, otherwise it is appropriate to submit it to the relevant department for approval.</li>
<li>p) Data that does not involve state secrets, important data or other data that are prohibited or restricted from being provided outside the country, the controller may provide personal health data to overseas destinations with the consent of the subject’s authorization and the consent of the Data Security Committee for discussion and approval, and it is appropriate to control the cumulative amount of data within 250 items, otherwise it is appropriate to submit it to the relevant department for approval.</li>
<li>q) It is not appropriate for the controller to store health data in servers outside the country, and not to host or lease servers outside the country.</li>
<li>r) When the controller cooperates in data development and utilization, it is appropriate to adopt the open form of “data analysis platform” and strictly control the disclosure of data use.</li>

<h3 id="10-2-De-identification"><a href="#10-2-De-identification" class="headerlink" title="10.2 De-identification"></a>10.2 De-identification</h3><p>It is appropriate for controllers to carry out de-identification in accordance with GB&#x2F;T37964-2019, and de-identified data should be applied to controlled public sharing or enclave public sharing (an environment fully controlled by controllers), and it is appropriate to agree on the purpose, manner, duration, and security measures for data use through data use agreements. The de-identification strategy, process and results are desirable to be approved by the Data Security Committee. When data are applied to clinical research and pharmaceutical&#x2F;medical R&amp;D, the relevant requirements are as follows.</p>
<p>a) It is appropriate to remove information in personal attribute data that can be uniquely identified with an individual or whose disclosure would have a significant impact on the individual, such as: name; ID card&#x2F;driver’s license and other document numbers; telephone numbers, faxes, e-mails; health insurance numbers, medical record numbers, accounts; biometric information (information unrelated to the purpose of the application such as fingerprints, voice, etc.); photographs; hobbies, beliefs, etc.<br>b) Information in personal attribute data that can be indirectly associated with individuals is appropriate for generalization, conversion, and other processing, such as<br>    - 1) information such as employer, address, postal code, etc., if the employer information or the population covered by the combination with other information is more than 20,000 people, the employer information can be retained; if the address information includes province (municipality directly under the Central Government), city (county), street (township) or the population covered by the combination with other information is more than 20,000 people, it can be retained, otherwise it is appropriate to remove the street (township) to ensure that the population covered by the combination is above; if the population covered by zip code information or combined with other information is above 10,000, it can be retained, otherwise it is appropriate to set the low zip code to ‘0’ to ensure that the population that can be covered is above 10,000.<br>    - 2) Generalization of a specific age, for example, giving an age range. For example, 38 years old can be converted into 30 to 40 years old to ensure that the number of people meeting the same age condition in the same region is more than 20,000.<br>    - 3) Birthdays and all other date information, e.g., admission time, discharge time, can only be specific to the year, or time drift processing.<br>c) It is appropriate to remove the names of health workers and other identifying information.<br>d) It is desirable to have a minimum number of 5 or more people in the dataset with the same value for all attributes.<br>e) For cases that need to be traced back to a patient, it is appropriate to create a patient code index within the controller.<br>f) The configuration of various parameters used in the de-identification process, such as time drift ranges, patient code indexes, and various individual code generation rules, should be kept strictly confidential and limited to the controller’s internal dedicated management.<br>g) When re-identification is required to identify the subject, it is desirable that the process be handled by the controller’s internal personnel and that the process be kept strictly confidential.<br>h) It is desirable to prohibit data users from participating in the work related to de-identification.<br>i) It is advisable to sign a data use agreement to govern the purpose and duration of data use and data protection measures, etc.<br>j) In a controlled public sharing model, it is appropriate for users to record data usage and be audited by the controller.<br>Related examples are shown in Table 6. The identifier categories of health information data elements and the proposed de-identification methods can be found in Appendix G.</p>

<td>Name</td>
<td>Suggest to delete or set to empty</td>
<td>Subject’s name, Doctor’s name, Researcher’s name, Family member’s name</td>

<td>Suggest to delete or set to empty or generalize. For example, the address should only be specified to the city or county level, hiding the address below the county level</td>
<td>Personal telephone number, email, account, address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date</td>
<td>It is suggested to adopt the “time shifting method”, conversion method, or generalization. For example, different random offset values can be defined for different research projects, and data disturbance can be achieved by adding or subtracting the random offset value from the date and time, to achieve data de-identification. For example: Admission date 2018-01-01 + Random offset value 100 &#x3D; Admission date: 2018-04-11, Discharge date 2018-04-01 + Random offset value 100 &#x3D; Discharge date: 2018-07-10.  Discharge date - admission date &#x3D; 90 days.  Through this method, data de-identification can be ensured while ensuring the correctness of the calculation logic. The conversion method is to replace the result obtained by using it and other dates with operations, such as the length of stay. Generalization only retains the year and month, or even only the year.</td>
<td>Time information in medical application that can be associated with individuals through data analysis: for example, admission date, discharge date, surgery date, etc</td>

<tr>
<td>Age</td>
<td>It is suggested to use the method of “data generalization.” For example: — Age ≤ 89 or &gt; 89 — Age interval &lt;25, 25-29, 30-34, …, 85-89, &gt;89. Note: &gt; 89 cannot be further sub-divided.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number</td>
<td>It is suggested to delete or set to empty. If it is necessary to use the uniqueness of numbers for logical analysis, such as judging whether multiple medical records belong to the same person through ID numbers, randomization based on the original data can be used to generate unique identification for replacement. If it is necessary to use implicit geographical information such as postal codes, disturbance and generalization methods can be used for processing, such as: original postal code record 100080, de-identified as 100* * * after generalization.</td>
<td>ID card number, social security card number, work permit number, and residency card number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>internal number assigned by medical institutions</td>
<td>It is recommended to replace or delete them. If these numbers are needed for logical analysis, a unique identifier can be generated based on the original data through randomization. If these numbers are not needed for logical analysis, they should be deleted.</td>
<td>Exam result report number, check report number, hospitalization number, outpatient (emergency) number, etc.</td>
